Raptor is a serverless feature engineering platform. It helps you to create production-ready ML features directly from
your notebook
and take it to production in less than 5 minutes.

With Raptor, data scientists can stop waiting for others to build production-ready version of their work. Instead,
slightly tweak your Python code and write your features' code in a notebook. Then, export the features to Kubernetes,
and RaptorML will take care of the production and engineering concerns (such as scale, high availability,
authentication, caching, monitoring, etc.)
